# Interactive visualizations

## Overview

The goal of this repo is to implement interactive and animated visualizations of Electricity Consumption and Occupancy (ECO) data. These are two interactive plots generated using `Plotly` and `Altair` packages in Python. Data are processed by R. 

## Data

This assignment will be based on a subset of the Electricity Consumption and Occupancy (ECO) data set, available [here](https://georgetown.box.com/s/kylbd32l3shrlhyrphkh93nxovtvttsy). This is a Box link, and you will have to sign in with your GU credentials to access the data.

Data from three households are provided, comprising  power consumption overall (from smart meters) and particular plugs/appliances per second over a period of time. For the smart meter data, the primary interest is the variable `powerallphases` which is the sum of real power over all power phases consumed in the household. The plugs data provides appliance-level consumption. 

State clearly the question(s) you want to address with your two graphics. There are many dimensions to explore, so don't necessarily restrict yourself to a simple time-series of a variable, which is obvious.
